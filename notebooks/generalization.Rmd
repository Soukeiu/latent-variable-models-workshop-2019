## Generalizing latent variables

Latent variables are used very widely in a variety of contexts.  Here are some examples.

- Dimension reduction (as demonstrated)
- Discovering latent constructs (as demonstrated)
- Scale development (as demonstrated)
- Utilizing random effects (mixed models)
- Ability assessment (item response theory)
- Exploring latent categorical variables/models (cluster analysis/mixture models)
- Making recommendations (recommender systems)
- Latent state transitions over time (hidden markov models)
- Discovering latent topics in text (topic modeling)

And many, many more.  See this [document](https://m-clark.github.io/docs/FA_notes.html) for some examples.
